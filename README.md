# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

to run the project:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

to run the tests:
### `npm test`

## Other notes
I haven't used reusable components and Redux because all the code takes less than 100 lines (without tests) and doesn't share state between components.
